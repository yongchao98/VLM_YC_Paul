Our initial goal is to implement Qwen (https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen1.5) on Harvard cluster

To set up the environment on Harvard cluster, we need to first install miniconda https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/miniconda-install.html
Then install the requied packages with conda and pip
Please record all the command lines so that other users can reproduce your results.
